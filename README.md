### ✋ Hand Tracking AR UI — A Futuristic Augmented Reality Interface

This project is an **Augmented Reality (AR) Hand Tracking User Interface** built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.  
It detects your hand in real-time via webcam and overlays **futuristic AR UI elements** — such as **radial gauges, HUD effects, and gesture-based animations** — directly on your hand.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔹 **Real-time Hand Tracking** powered by MediaPipe  
- 🌀 **AR-style UI Overlays** — concentric circles, radial ticks, and core effects  
- ✊ **Gesture Recognition** — open hand, pinch, and fist modes  
- 💡 **Dynamic Visual Feedback** based on motion and position  
- 🧠 **All Graphics Generated Programmatically** — no external assets
